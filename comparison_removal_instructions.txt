// Instructions for removing "So sánh & Gợi ý" JavaScript code

Since we removed the "So sánh & Gợi ý" (Comparison & Suggestions) section from the HTML, 
we need to remove the related JavaScript code as well. Here are the parts to remove:

1. In the updateAllPerformanceMetrics function (around line 2165):
   Find and remove or comment out this line:
   ```
   updatePerformanceAnalysis(gamePerformance, graphicPerformance, officePerformance, livestreamPerformance, renderPerformance);
   ```

2. Remove the entire updatePerformanceAnalysis function (around lines 2170-2225)

3. Remove the entire addRecommendation function (around lines 2227-2233)

4. Search for and remove any other references to updatePerformanceAnalysis (like line 2836)

5. Check for and remove any code that references these IDs:
   - price-performance-chart
   - optimization-suggestions
   - performance-tip
   - selected-game-name
   - future-upgrade-suggestion
   - basic-comparison
   - pro-comparison
   - creator-comparison
   - installment-6, installment-12, installment-18
   - alternative-configs

This will ensure all related JavaScript functionality is removed along with the HTML section.
